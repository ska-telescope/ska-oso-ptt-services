SKA OSO Project Tracking Tool Services
========================================

The Project Tracking Tool will provide the user with a summary view of the status of their project and
associated Observing Blocks and Scheduling Blocks.

The PTT will have access to view all defined projects and to update the status of all defined projects across 
ALL observing cycles.

The SKA OSO PTT is a tool currently under development. The Project Tracking Tool Services is the server component of the Project Tracking Tool.
It provides backend service for the PTT in order to manage its current functionality.

Current Project Tracking Tool Services allow users to query SKAâ€™s OSO Data Archive for information on 
Scheduling Block Definition(SBD), Scheduling Block Instance(SBI), Execution Block(EB) and Projects stored in the database
and links between them and display the results on the GUI.
