SKAO Project Tracking Tool Services
========================================

The Project Tracking Tool will provide the user with a summary view of the status of their project and
associated Observing Blocks and Scheduling Blocks.

The PTT will have access to view all defined projects and to update the status of all defined projects across 
all observing cycles.

The Project Tracking Tool Services is the server component of the Project Tracking Tool UI.
It provides backend service for the PTT UI in order to manage its current functionality.

Current Project Tracking Tool Services allow users to query SKA's OSO Data Archive for information on Project, Scheduling Block Definition(SBD),Scheduling Block Instance(SBI) and Execution Block(EB) stored in the database
and links between them and display the results on the GUI.
